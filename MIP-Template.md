> [!NOTE] 
> Rename this file to mip-x.md in your proposal. If more than one MIP will be submitted, then a suffix can be added to each file as mip-x-foo.md, mip-x-bar.md, etc. MIP numbering will automatically be applied with renamed filenames when merged.

["Status" should be one of: Draft | Review | Last Call | Accepted | Implemented | Postponed | Declined | Discontinued]

["Stability" describes the stability of the implementation. Prior to implementation it should be left as "n/a". Once implemented, the stability will be one of: Experimental | Stable | Deprecated]

["Author(s)" should have a comma-separated list of the MIP authors. Each author MUST be written in the following format: `Name Surname <email> (@github-username)`. If the author wants to maintain anonymity, they MAY provide only the username instead of their name and surname. The e-mail and github username are optional and MAY be provided. At least one of the authors MUST have a Github username provided in order to be notified of the changes concerning their MIP.]

["Type" should either be "Community" or "Maintainer". If you are not an API Maintainer, then please use "Community". You can learn more about the distinction between these types in the [Process Guide](./PROCESS-GUIDE.md).]
