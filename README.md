# MetaMask Improvement Proposals (MIPs) Repository
Welcome to the MetaMask Improvement Proposals (MIPs) repository. This repository serves as a public space to discuss, evaluate, and implement improvements to the MetaMask Wallet API. Our goal is to create a more robust and effective API by actively involving developers and prioritizing their feedback.

## Core Aims and Approach
1. Establish a transparent process for MetaMask Improvement Proposals.
2. Prioritize feedback and improvements from developers who are actively integrating with MetaMask.
3. Ensure a committed set of developers are ready to adopt changes before investing time in implementation.


# Process Guidelines
