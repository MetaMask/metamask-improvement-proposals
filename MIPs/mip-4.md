## Summary
This proposal aims to add a new JSON-RPC method, `wallet_openDeepLink`, to MetaMask. This method is designed to offer programmatic navigation within MetaMask to the API consumer, in particular, to dapps and Snaps.

## Motivation
Currently, there isn't a way for developers to navigate to specific portions of MetaMask. With the introduction of [MetaMask schemed URLs](https://github.com/MetaMask/SIPs/pull/134) and the ability to navigate to them through Snaps link components, we wanted to utilize the full power of the new scheme through allowing a RPC method that would allow consumers to navigate to selected portions of MetaMask.

# Proposal
The `wallet_openDeepLink` method is proposed as a new JSON-RPC feature for MetaMask, aimed at giving users navigation ability to exposed routes within the client or a Snap. For a list of the routes currently exposed, please see [SIP-22](https://github.com/MetaMask/SIPs/pull/134). In the future, MetaMask URLs will also accept fragments to navigate to a specific portion of a page. This API can also be extended to accept params that can pre-populate fields on a certain page. The authority would be responsible for choosing to accept certain params. In the case of the "client" authority, MetaMask is responsible for keeping a record of the params for each exposed route. In the case of the "snap" authority, the Snap itself is responsible for params handling and communication of route parameters.

# Usage Example
```js
await window.ethereum.request({
  "method": "wallet_openDeepLink",
  "params": {
    "link": "metamask://client/"
  }
});
```

```js
await window.ethereum.request({
  "method": "wallet_openDeepLink",
  "params": {
    "link": "metamask://snap/@metamask/examplesnap/home"
  }
});
```

## Implementation
The Snaps team will be responsible for implementing the `wallet_openDeepLink` method and for future improvements to it.

## Feedback
Please provide feedback on this proposal by opening an issue in the MetaMask MIPs repository.
